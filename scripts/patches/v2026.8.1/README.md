# OpenClaw v2026.8.1 patch notes

## Manual lock-owner recovery

`zz-openclaw-lock-owner-recovery.patch` adds an optional asynchronous
`inspectOwner` hook to native gateway lock acquisition. LobsterAI's manual
repair helper uses it to distinguish stale PID references from live owners.
Native SQLite coordination and the file lock manager's remove-if-unchanged
checks remain authoritative; other callers retain the default owner policy.

The patch also uses `.NET Process.StartTime` for Windows process creation
identity and gives gateway lock queries a 5-second budget. An unavailable
identity remains unknown. LobsterAI may stop an orphan only after verifying
its executable, runtime entry, state/config ownership, creation identity,
parent exit and protection window; healthy gateways stay protected.

Rebuild startup/repair helpers before the opt-in Windows integration checks:

```powershell
$env:LOBSTERAI_TEST_LOCK_RECOVERY='1'
$env:OPENCLAW_LOCK_RECOVERY_SOURCE='<patched-openclaw-checkout>'
npm test -- openclawLockRecovery.runtime
```

The build rejects a source checkout missing the hook. Keep this patch until
the pinned upstream provides an equivalent native manual-recovery boundary.
See [the design and acceptance record](../../../specs/bugfixes/openclaw-lock-owner-recovery/2026-09-17-lock-owner-recovery-design.md).

## LobsterAI provider cooldown

`openclaw-lobsterai-provider-cooldown.patch` adds `lobsterai-server` to the
existing provider-managed auth cooldown bypass. LobsterAI's local token proxy
owns login refresh, and its server enforces user quota and selects upstream
model credentials. A billing/auth failure from one upstream model must not
disable the shared proxy credential and block other models for the agent.

The shared predicate covers both failure persistence and auth availability,
including already-persisted `inline-api-key:lobsterai-server` cooldowns. No
credential or SQLite migration is needed. Other providers retain their existing
cooldowns; real login and quota errors still reach the user.

After applying the patch, run the two owning upstream suites:

```sh
pnpm test src/agents/auth-profiles/usage.test.ts src/agents/model-auth.profiles.test.ts
```

Regression cases cover auth/billing failure writes and existing billing state
with both literal and environment-backed proxy credentials. The runtime build
fingerprint includes this patch; rebuild through `npm run electron:dev:openclaw`
before testing the fix in the desktop app. Remove this patch when the pinned
upstream provides an equivalent provider-managed cooldown contract.

## Auth migration config commit

`openclaw-auth-migration-config-commit.patch` adds an optional
`persistConfig(cfg): Promise<void>` callback to the upstream auth migration
owner. LobsterAI uses it to persist migrated auth metadata before the owner
archives the original credential files. This boundary is internal to the owner;
writing configuration after the function returns is too late to preserve retry
behavior when the config write fails.

The callback runs only when the current candidate changes configuration, after
any required SQLite import has been verified. It also covers AWS SDK markers
that have no credential rows and config-only credentials that have no source
JSON files. The original source and its existing archive history remain intact
if the callback rejects. Existing callers without the callback are unchanged.

The host callback must persist with optimistic concurrency checks, surface a
failed commit, and retry with freshly loaded configuration. It must not replace
the owner's credential parser or write authentication SQLite tables itself.
LobsterAI holds the upstream stopped-Gateway maintenance lock around this work.

Validation from the LobsterAI checkout, after applying patches and rebuilding
the startup migration helper:

```sh
OPENCLAW_STARTUP_MIGRATION_RUNTIME=<runtime-dir> npm test -- openclawAuthProfileMigration
```

Fixtures use temporary state and synthetic credentials. Required cases include
ordinary non-main-agent migration, marker-only config persistence, failed config
commit followed by retry, and repeated startup without unrelated config changes.
Remove the patch once the pinned upstream owner provides an equivalent commit
boundary.

## Browser DNS failure and Gateway process recovery

Three independent patches contain browser failures at their owners. A DNS
failure in a Playwright document route must finish the affected request rather
than leak an unhandled rejection or terminate the Gateway. Restoring the global
handler alone keeps the process alive but can leave navigation waiting for its
timeout.

| Patch | Purpose and upstream source |
| --- | --- |
| `openclaw-gateway-fast-path-rejection-handler.patch` | Backports [#141163](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/141163), commit `1ddd53680b6bbc1d725fd67edc9ffa31944dfe86`: install existing process error handlers before the Gateway fast path, without duplicate registration on full CLI fallback. |
| `openclaw-browser-navigation-error-containment.patch` | Change only `gotoPageWithNavigationGuard` in `pw-session-navigation.ts`, own all route callback failures, terminate failed requests, and contain late asynchronous work. Adds `pw-session-navigation.rejection.test.ts`. |
| `openclaw-browser-cdp-dispatch-rejection.patch` | Backports [#150177](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/150177), commit `22572027ded601e128335c45c537a37113b384d5`: catch rejected CDP message dispatch promises and close the affected connection using its existing lifecycle. |

The navigation fix covers Playwright-based navigation in managed Chrome,
extension relay, and direct CDP profiles. The default LobsterAI in-app browser
uses `existing-session` through the MCP bridge and Electron navigation; it does
not execute this route callback. Inspect the actual profile/driver when testing
fallbacks or explicitly selected profiles.

Only known transient network errors from `assertBrowserNavigationAllowed` are
isolated to a subframe; unknown errors and `continue` failures still fail the
operation. DNS failures do not quarantine or close an existing page. Error
precedence is top-level policy denial, then ordinary `guardError`, then
`page.goto` failure, then cleanup failure. A `stopSignal` ends the wait for DNS;
late resolution/rejection remains observed and cannot continue the stale route.
Only the exact handler is removed. The full unroute-and-in-flight-drain cleanup
chain shares a 1000ms grace period, independent of the remaining goto timeout.
The patch adds no diagnostic logs and leaves adjacent navigation guards alone.

Apply the patch set through `npm run openclaw:patch`, run the owning upstream
startup, navigation, and CDP regression suites, and rebuild the runtime through
the normal OpenClaw runtime build flow. Verify real-browser DNS failure,
Gateway PID/readiness continuity, and subsequent browser operations on that
runtime. A source test or an isolated Chrome experiment does not establish
packaged-app, IM, or cross-platform coverage. The full scope and validation
record live in the [bugfix design](../../../specs/bugfixes/openclaw-browser-dns-recovery/2026-09-17-openclaw-browser-dns-recovery-design.md).

### Validation record (2026-09-17)

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Complete patch reapplication | Two complete runs of all 42 patches; each reported `Applied 42 / Skipped 0`. |
| LobsterAI patch suite | 20 files; 69 passed, 1 skipped (70 total). |
| Host checks | Changed-file strict ESLint, `node --check scripts/apply-openclaw-patches.cjs`, and `compile:electron` passed. |
| OpenClaw browser regression | 3 files, all 65 tests passed, including 13 new navigation cases, CDP, and existing navigation guard coverage. |
| OpenClaw process error policy | All 54 `unhandled-rejections` and all 10 `fatal-detection` tests passed. |
| Full OpenClaw CLI regression | Patched: 252 passed, 3 failed (255 total). Original `run-main.ts` and `exit.test.ts` restored: 248 passed, the same 3 failed with identical assertions (251 total). |
| Independent read-only navigation review | No outstanding finding. |
| Final QA runtime build | All `qaRuntime` phases passed; final build completed in 2m19.6s. |
| Real Gateway + managed Chrome | Six required scenarios passed; a separate client-side top-level redirect returned raw Node `ENOTFOUND` from the route guard in 1177ms. All 76 health checks passed on the same PID and WebSocket; zero unexpected disconnects. |

The three CLI failures reproduce on the original source and concern POSIX path
fixtures on Windows; they were left unchanged. The total differs by the four
new fast-path tests, which are absent from the original test file. This is not a
claim that the full CLI suite passed. The initial navigation red run covered
11 cases (9 failed, 2 passed); two boundary cases were added afterward, so the
current 13 cases were not all rerun against the original implementation.

Automated review was launched but its preflight rejected before sending because
TruffleHog is unavailable locally. No automated review conclusion was obtained;
this is neither a product failure nor a completed review. Ordinary oxlint
(warnings as errors) and oxfmt passed for all six changed upstream files.
The upstream changed gate passed conflict-marker and max-lines checks, then
stopped on assertion-SAFETY violations in seven files modified by existing
patches outside these three fixes. Broad type-aware lint and scoped tsgo could
not complete under local memory pressure; full OpenClaw type validation remains
a build-machine follow-up. The final live run used fresh Windows state/profile
and the rebuilt checkout, with LobsterAI's default proxy-compatible network
setting and blocked-host policy still active. A bad iframe was aborted while
its main page loaded, the same tab recovered, and policy denial remained effective.
The HTTP 302 case returned a Chromium DNS error and is distinct from the Node
route-guard case. Source/entry hashes matched; logs had no unhandled rejection
or uncaught exception. All four owned ports closed during cleanup; the final
Windows taskkill exit code is intentional cleanup. Actual user extension/attached
profiles, in-app MCP, packaged-app, real IM, and cross-platform acceptance are
not recorded as complete; see the design record.

### Retirement when upgrading OpenClaw

**Upgrading to `v2026.9.4` allows removal of only the fast-path handler patch
after equivalence and regression checks; do not remove all three patches.**

| Patch | Decision for `v2026.9.4` | Later removal condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gateway fast-path handler | May remove: [that tag's `run-main.ts`](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/v2026.9.4/src/cli/run-main.ts#L1506) already contains #141163. | Confirm handlers are installed before actual Gateway work and only once on every shipped startup path, then pass the owning regression. |
| Browser navigation containment | Retain and port to the target source. The inspected [main navigation implementation](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/5d1389f2c8a3546e2c6dd52bafe90a09e1667460/extensions/browser/src/browser/pw-session-navigation.ts#L409) still rethrows ordinary route DNS errors. | Remove only the portions covered by equivalent upstream route failure, request completion, and late-callback cleanup behavior; retain the regression contracts. |
| Browser CDP dispatch | Retain: #150177 merged on 2026-09-16 UTC / 2026-09-17 Asia/Shanghai, after `v2026.9.4` was published. | A later pinned release must contain #150177 or equivalent behavior and pass synchronous/asynchronous dispatch and connection-close regressions. |

Upstream inspection is fixed at main commit
`5d1389f2c8a3546e2c6dd52bafe90a09e1667460` on 2026-09-17. Recheck the exact
upgrade tag, update patch manifests/validators and this record, then rebuild;
a closed PR, patch conflict, or global rejection listener alone is not evidence
that all three fixes are obsolete.
